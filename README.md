# Putter.app

I like [put.io][putio]'s service, but I hate copy-pasting magnet urls to and from Safari. So I made this little app, that handles `magnet:`-urls and sends them to your Put.io-account.

## Screenshots

Well, this is as crazy as it gets:

## Download

You can download a pre-built versions that should work here: [Putter.app][zip].

## Future

It should probably also handle `.torrent`-files?

## License

Do what you like.
